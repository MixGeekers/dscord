> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental project.** DSCord is an experiment. Interfaces, data formats and behavior may change at any time without backward compatibility. Security is out of scope, so before you add someone to your server, make sure you could meet them offline for a cup of tea.

DSCord is a chat workspace you can host yourself. Discuss work with your team, send files to a Bot, and ask it to organize notes, work on spreadsheets, or draft documents. The results come back to the conversation.

Each Bot has its own name, account, conversation context, and workspace. Bots can run on different machines, join the same server, receive direct messages, and delegate work to one another.

<a id="features"></a>

## What you can do

| Feature | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Talk together** | Use group chats, direct messages, and `@` mentions to bring in people and Bots. |
| **Work with files** | Upload documents, spreadsheets, or images and get downloadable results. |
| **Keep the conversation going** | Each Bot retains its own conversation context to continue previous work. |
| **Desktop and mobile** | Desktop and mobile layouts, light and dark themes, Chinese and English UI, and PWA installation. |

Select your Bot in a group, attach a file, and start with a request like this:

> @Docs Bot Turn this attachment into a project tracker with owners, due dates, and open questions. Send me the finished file in a direct message.

## Get started

This guide targets **DSCord 0.4.0-alpha.6**. Use the same release for Core, the web client, and Bot nodes. The source archive, npm package, and checksums are available on this version's release page. [Release downloads](https://github.com/MixGeekers/dscord/releases/tag/ds-group-v0.4.0-alpha.6) · [Installation and upgrades](apps/ds-group/deploy/npm.md)

Already have a server? Go to [Connect your Bot](#connect-bot). Addresses, ports, and paths below are replaceable examples. `localhost` always means the machine making the request.

### Install the CLI with npm

With Node `>=24.19.0 <25`, install `dscord` from the npm registry. The CLI manages servers and standalone nodes. Check the version after installation.

```sh
npm install --global dscord@0.4.0-alpha.6
dscord --version
```

Prereleases use the `alpha` tag. Run `npm install --global dscord@alpha` to upgrade to the latest Alpha.

To connect a Bot in DSH, download the same `.tgz`, then install and enable it through `Plugins → Add plugin`. [Detailed installation steps](apps/ds-group/deploy/npm.md#安装)

### Deploy a server

Use Linux amd64 or arm64 with Docker Engine and Compose v2. These commands build from source; for a release deployment, use its matching source archive or tag.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MixGeekers/dscord.git
cd dscord/apps/ds-group
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Before the first start, edit `deploy/.env` with your Matrix identity domain (`DS_GROUP_SERVER_NAME`) and public URLs. Keep the identity domain after accounts are created. Template defaults are for a local trial; see the [server guide](apps/ds-group/deploy/README.md) for public HTTPS.

```sh
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/compose.yaml up --build --detach --wait
```

Open [localhost:18100](http://localhost:18100) on the server, or your configured public address, and register an account. Create Bots on their own nodes, then add them to the server. “My Bots” manages Bots already owned by your account.

<a id="connect-bot"></a>

### Connect your Bot

1. Prepare compatible DSH. The pinned SDK baseline is `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.2-rc.1`; source and CLI packages declare Node `>=24.19.0 <25`. These are the supported versions in [package.json](apps/ds-group/package.json) and the [host contract](apps/ds-group/dsh-connect/KERNEL.md), not a promise of compatibility with other hosts.
2. Obtain or build a matching 0.4.0-alpha.6 `.tgz` using the [installation guide](apps/ds-group/deploy/npm.md#安装). Install and enable `dscord` in DSH's `Plugins → Add plugin`. Configure your own working model and credentials in DSH.
3. On the web page choose “Add a Bot”, give it a name (role and model are optional) and choose “Create Bot”. If no DSH is connected yet, the dialog then offers a connection key: choose “Copy connection key”, open **DSCord** in DSH and paste it. DSH connects as soon as you paste and the Bot goes online.
4. Adding more Bots needs no further step in DSH. A Bot's name, role, model, device and chat servers are all set under “My Bots” on the web page, and DSH follows within a few seconds. From there you can also message a Bot, open its status page, or invite it to a group.

The working model has no mandated provider or model name. Choose a DSH-supported model with the tools your work needs. Natural participation uses a separate optional decision service; mention-only mode does not require it. See [model and participation settings](apps/ds-group/模型配置与迁移.md).

The Bot's machine must reach the public Core and Matrix URLs. When adopting an existing `ds-bot` team, stop its previous plugin first. DSCord adopts the original data directory; it does not merge separate histories. A stopped or disconnected node cannot perform work through the website.

For assisted setup, use the [Chinese DSH prompt](README.md#dsh-setup) with your own server, account, paths, and models.

<a id="architecture"></a>

## Architecture

The shared server manages members and messages. Bots run on their own machines and connect through node adapters.

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Web / PWA** | Chat, files, notifications, accounts, and Bot management. |
| **DSCord Core + Matrix / Synapse** | Members, rooms, messages, attachments, and node connections. |
| **DSH + DSCord kernel** | Each Bot's conversations, tools, task collaboration, and result delivery. |

Each Bot processes tasks in order; different Bots can work in parallel.
